# horisenon-refactor
I changed some divs to specific semantic elements such as header, footer, nav, etc. Additionally, I changed the footer to h4 rather than the h2 it was listed as. I included alt tags to give images descriptions for those using screen readers. Lastly, I incorporated the “do not repeat” method into my css code to group selectors.
