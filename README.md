# horisenon-refactor
The goal of this project was to increase website accessibility for those using screen readers, replace div tags with semantic elements, and group selectors in css. In order to complete this request, I included alt tags to give images descriptions for those using screen readers. I changed unspecific div tags to specific semantic elements such as header, footer, nav, etc. Additionally, I changed the footer from h2 to h4 for better sequential structure.  Lastly, I incorporated the “do not repeat” method into my css code to group selectors.
